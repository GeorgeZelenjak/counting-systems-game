# counting-systems-game

This is the game I made in *2018* as a project for one of the programming courses I took.
While it is not a really exciting game, and pretty poorly written, it is my first project which I have spent quite a lot of time on.

# Disclaimer

At the moment, I plan on cleaning the repository and removing all non-python files. I also want to fix character's movement for my laptop (I have made the game on my desktop where everything was fine).

# Dependencies
* python3
* pygame
* pyganim

# How to run
* cd `counting-systems-game/Game\ 1080x810\ \(EST\)/CountingSystemsGame/` (or another game with another language and resolution) 
* If on *Windows*, run `CountingSystemsGame.exe` in this directory.
  Alternatively, you can run `python CountingSystemsGame.py`(worked for me on Windows 10)
* For *Linux* (Arch Linux, namely) there is currently an issue with the input and some keys.
  While you can still move around and enjoy the immortal music, you will not get the nice experience with the game.
  I will try to fix it, *but cannot promise*.
* I haven't tried the game on *MacOS*.

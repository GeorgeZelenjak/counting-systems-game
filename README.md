# counting-systems-game

This is the game I made in *2018* as a project for one of the programming courses I took.

While it is not a really exciting game, and pretty poorly written, it is my first project which I have spent quite a lot of time on.

The purpose of the game is to practice converting numbers from one counting system into another (namely from base 10 into base 2, base 8 and base 16 and vice versa) in a fun way.


# Dependencies

* python3
* pygame
* pyganim


# How to run

**NB! The game was created on Windows and for the best gaming experience I would recommend using it. The game works on GNU/Linux (I have tested it on Arch), however the fonts are a bit off as the game uses MicroSoft fonts**

### To play a game

* `cd Games/Game1080x810_est` (or another game with another language and resolution)
* `python CountingSystemsGame.py`

### To use a calculator

* `cd Calcs`
* `python calc_rus.py` or `python calc_est.py`
